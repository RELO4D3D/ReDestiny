# ReDestiny
Analysis and recreation of systems seen in Destiny from Bungie.

Destiny has numerous systems in place with a common UI theme that is modified based on need. This project attempts to utilize UE4 to recreate each usage case and provide a similar experience to the console version.

By deconstructing each element and building it back up, the goal is to better understand the strengths of Destiny's system and to tweak it to further improve its usability.

NOTE: I do not own much of the assets used within this project. Many images and textures are available from UE4's "Starter Content" libraries or directly from the Destiny "Armory" at Bungie.net (or via API if you are adventurous and enjoy digging around in hash-named assets).
